What did we do well that we should try to do again?
 We used our resources, and asking questions/for help.
 




What did we do poorly that we should try to correct?
Using the wrong resources and trying to correct errors that didn't need to be fixed.




Did we achieve our goals?
Why or why not?

No but kind of.
We did not finish our testing entirely due to unexpected errors.  We got half way through our tests with the adding and subtracting.
